#  Node-RED Dashboard – Cooperative Thermal Alert Network (CTAN)

This branch contains the **Node-RED flow and dashboard** flows for the *Cooperative Thermal Alert Network (CTAN)*.  
Node-RED dashboard provides **real-time monitoring**, **visual alerts**, and **control capabilities** for the ESP32 sensor nodes and the gateway.

---

## Overview

The Node-RED dashboard acts as the **central user interface** for the system.  
It communicates with the ESP32 gateway and all sensor nodes through **MQTT**.

- Live temperature & humidity readings  
- Color-coded alert indicators  
- Gateway status monitoring    
- Data visualization graphs  
  

Thus, this setup allows a user to observe and interact with the cooperative sensor network in real-time.

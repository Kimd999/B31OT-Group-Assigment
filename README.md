##  Overview

The **Cooperative Thermal Alert Network (CTAN)** system is designed to detect abnormal temperature conditions and coordinate alerts between interconnected sensor nodes, representing by ESP32 MCU equipped with DHT11 sensors.

Each node monitors local temperature, communicates peer-to-peer using **ESP-NOW**, and shares data with a **gateway** connected to a **web dashboard** for real-time supervision.

##  System Architecture

### Components
- **ESP32 Sensor Nodes (x3+)**
  - Equipped with a DHT11 temperature sensor
  - RGB LED for visual alert indication
  - Communicate using ESP-NOW
- **ESP32 Gateway Node**
  - Connects to nodes via ESP-NOW
  - Publishes data and alerts to an MQTT broker
  - Hosts or connects to a web-based dashboard

### Communication Flow
1. Each node monitors temperature locally.  
2. If a threshold is exceeded, the node:
   - Activates local LED alert  
   - Broadcasts an alert message to neighbors via ESP-NOW  
3. Gateway receives and forwards data to MQTT broker.  
4. Dashboard visualizes node data and alerts.
